One of the many Steam sales coming this holiday season, we start of with Halloween. Looking through the games, there's a ton of them on sale up to 50% off. A good chunck of them are horror based, but there's a decent amount that aren't. I know a couple of games on my wish list has dropped in price, such as Axiom Verge, which is currently 9 bucks! Now's a great time to clear up your growing wish list of games.
