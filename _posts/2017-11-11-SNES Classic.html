Back in the day, the Super Nintendo was a sizable upgrade from the original NES, and I was 
amazed at how much the graphics improved. New tech such as Mode 7, and later the FX chip 
allowed the SNES to do things the Genesis wish it could. 26 years later, (man I feel old!) 
Nintendo decided to retug on our nostalgia strings and release the SNES classic. <!--more--></p>

Much like the NES classic, the SNES classic is a smaller model from the original, packed 
with the best games of it's generation. It comes with two controllers, an HDMI cable, one 
USB cable with AC adapter, 21 SNES games, and of course, the manual. Games like Super 
Mario Cart, F-Zero, Super Metroid, and Star Fax are included. Even the unreleased Star Fox 
2 is part of that list! Those that remember games from this generation would be smitten to 
play these awesome titles again.

The SNE Classic has been out since September 29th, and like the NES classic, it's a 
limited-edition product. You'd be hard pressed to find it a copy of it in a Gamestop or 
any physical retail store. The console is available online, however the price is more than 
doubled. The retail price was originally $79.99, but online prices are aorund $128 to 
$140. If the hiked up price doesn't bother you, then there's plenty to go around.
