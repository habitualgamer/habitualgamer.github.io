<p>Now’s a great time to be a MegaMan Fan. Capcom announced that Mega Man 11 will be coming to the Switch, PC, Xbox 1, and PS4 sometime late 2018. That’s right, we’re going back to good 'ol 2D Mega Man, but with a visual update.<!--more--> The art style will be drastically modernized, and I have to say at first glance, it looks really good. It reminded me of the art style Mighty No. 9 was attempting but actually accomplished. I’m interested in learning more, and I’m sure Capcom will show more as time goes on. But for now, we’re stuck with the announcement vid. That’s good enough for me, as I’m just happy a new Mega Man game is being made. And I’m very glad they’re sticking to his roots. After beating Cuphead, I was itching for some more run-and-gun action. Well here it is...until it’s released, that is. Check out the vid below!
