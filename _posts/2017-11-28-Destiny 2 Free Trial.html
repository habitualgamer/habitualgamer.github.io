<p>After writing my last <a href="https://hbgaming.net/2017/11/23/Should-I-get-Destiny-2.html">post</a>, and reading hella feedback from many sources (it was highly recommended), I decided not to purchase the game during the sale. Why? I just had a sneaky feeling I would enjoy the game for the first couple of weeks and discard it afterward.</p> <!--more--><p>I’ve played many MMORPGs and MMO-like games and if it ain't World of Warcraft, I won’t stick with it for more than a month. Of course, there are some exceptions. With this new announcement, I’m suddenly hyped about trying out the game! I can now take my time and really determine if it’s for me or not. For those, like me, who were on the fence about purchasing the game, our time has come! Who knows? I may see some long-term enjoyment from this one. Click the link below to give it a try for yourself. Destiny 2 is out on PC, Xbox One, and PS4.</p>
