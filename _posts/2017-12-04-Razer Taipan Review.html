As a lefty, I’ve always struggled with finding the right mouse/keyboard setup for PC Gaming. It was even harder when certain games don’t support custom keybinds. Now times have changed, and gaming as a lefty has been much easier. In the past, the biggest hurdle was finding a gaming mouse that’s compatible with the left hand. Most mice created were specifically for a right-hander. Fortunately, there are mice available that cater to both sides. For me, the best of the bunch is the Razer Taipan. <!--more--></br></br>

My goal for a gaming mouse was simple: An ambidextrous form factor, and an adequate amount of buttons. Not as crazy as the Razer Naga, but something better than a standard three-button mouse. The Taipan comes with 9 programmable buttons, which is more than enough for what I need to do. Many MMORPGs like World of Warcraft have 20+ keys you need to press at any given time. This mouse helps free some of those keybinds, making abilities more accessible. Clicking feels responsive and there’s never a sense of delay from click to action. Even playing games like StarCraft and Cities: Skylines, where your main control is clicking, feels greats. The mouse movement is seamless, boasting an 8500 dpi 4g laser sensor for that insane precision. I never really needed to go that high, but it’s there for those that may find it useful. </br></br>

The overall look is what sold me. I’m not a fan of those transformer, robotic-looking mice. I’m a simple guy, so a mouse with a simple, yet sleek design was something I was seeking. It has a sexy ambidextrous look with the flashing green Razer logo glowing on the front of the mouse. The scroll button also glows a vibrant green color, which makes the whole presentation subtle, yet appealing. The Taipan also comes with a tough beaded cord for that long-lasting durability. The rubber contoured grip on either side of the mouse helps with maintaining a comfortable grip for those long gaming sessions. </br></br>

The only gripe I have with the mouse is its size. It’s a standard-sized mouse, which is fine but may be considered small for hardcore gamers. Because of how the buttons are placed, reaching the side buttons felt awkward at times. I believe this is one of the flaws of having a symmetrical design. A mouse specifically for the right or left hand will have a much better button placement, but the Taipan does what it can to accommodate both lefties and righties. </br></br>

I’ve had this mouse for years, had the cords twisted out and everything, and it’s still going strong. For those lefty gamers looking for a gaming mouse that suits their needs, I highly recommend this one. It’s simple, yet sexy design, a multitude of buttons, tight precision, and great support via Razor Synapse makes this a must buy for gamers of all levels, regardless of what hand you use. Check out the Razor Taipan on Amazon! </br></br>
