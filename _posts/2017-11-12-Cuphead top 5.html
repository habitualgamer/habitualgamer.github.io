<p> Cuphead is an amazing game with great graphics, tight gameplay and swinging music. The difficuly feels about right and bosses posed a big challenge, but some bosses were much harder than others. This is entirely my opinion on the 5 top difficult Cuphead bosses, so others may have harder time with other bosses. For instance the Robot boss isn't on this list. Why? I have experience with bullet hell shooters, so any stage with bullet hell elements is a breeze. With that said, here are my 5 top difficult Cuphead bosses. <!--more--></p>
<h2>5. Rumor Honeybottoms</h2>

<p>
At the bottom of the list is Rumor Honeybottoms. The first half of the fight isn't so bad with Officer bee and his exploding bombs. The endless scrolling stage is what makes the fight challenging. Once Honeybottoms appear herself, things get even more tricker. With her summoning pink balls, homing bees that traverse up the platform in a quick random manner, and triangles that shoot...more triangles, she keeps you on your toes. Another aspect of the fight are randomly placed platforms. While the stage is slowing scrolling upwards, platforms may or may not be there when you need them, so being preemptive is a must.

<h2>4. Grim Matchstick</h2>

<p>This damn dragon. The first phase is fairly easy, dodging eye lazers, dragon tails, and fireballs. He kicks it up a notch in the second phase. With fireballs that randomly fling themselves towards you, you have to be aware of your last positioning since they seem like to go there. It's not until the final phase you'll ending tearing our hair out. Not only you have to be careful shooting the projectiles, you have to watch for his little flamthrower ablility. This is another stage with randomly placed clouds, so if he's throwing his flamethrower, but there's no cloud to dodge to, you better make sure you have enough health, or pre plan where you going to position yourself</p>
<h2>3. Cala Maria </h2>

<p>This boss gave me more trouble then she should've. What's messed up is bad RNG in the first phase. If you get the water horse and she decides to spit out thoat annoying pirate ghosts, I hope you mastered the shriking ability. The rest of her phases aren't too bad, but getting two bad ones are a pain. Her second phase is as difficult as you want it to be. You can focus on Cala and ignore the eels (and thier many bullets), or focus eels and eat her stone gaze move. It's a tight balance on keeping the eels at bay while maintaining damamge to the boss. Final phase is more annoying than anything. Moving to a tight corrider with stuff to dodge, including that stone gaze move makes the fight more about execution than anything. Most of the plane stages are simply execution - do what you're supposed to do, don't get hit by anything and profit. </p>
<h2>2. Hilda Berg </h2>

<p>For such an early boss, this one gave me a super hard time. I have no idea why I struggled so much on this one. It's like it said earlier, flying stages are execution based. Making stupid mistakes is my main downfall in this fight. If it's not the enemies shooting random bullets, or the boss and her "Hahaha" attacks, it's her transformations or the stars in the final stage. Of all the pre-King Dice fights, this was the one that took the longest to complete.</p>
<h2>1. King Dice Guantlent</h2>
<img class = "image" src ="http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/024/106/cuphead-king-dice-parry.jpg.optimal.jpg" align= "center">
<p>King Dice himself wasn't super hard, but getting to him definately was. His gauntlent is a series of mini-bosses you fight in a row before immediately starting your fight with the king of dice himself. It's imperative to collect as much hearts if you can if you're not on your parry game. The fight with King Dice is merely a parry-fest. If you can master the parry at this point, rest of the fight is trivial. Losing the fight takes you back to the beginning of the guantlent, starting at the beginning. That, in itself, what makes him the most difficult part of the game. Many times I almost gave up on beating this guy, but with enough determination, I ended triumphant! The devil was a pushover compared to this. </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>And that's all folks! Hope you enjoyed my list of top 5 Cuphead bosses. If you haven't tried it out the game, now's the best time. If you have, what were your hardest bosses? Let me know in the comments!</p>
