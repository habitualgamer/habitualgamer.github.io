<p> Cuphead is an one-of-a-kind game with great graphics, tight gameplay and swinging music. The difficuly is high and bosses posed a big challenge, but some were much harder than others. This is entirely my opinion, so others may have harder times with different bosses. For instance the Robot boss isn't on this list. Why? I have experience with bullet hell shooters, so any stage with bullet hell elements is a breeze. With that said, here are my 5 top difficult Cuphead bosses. <!--more--></p>
<h2>5. Rumor Honeybottoms</h2>

<p>
At the bottom of the list is Rumor Honeybottoms. The first half of the fight is doable with officer bee and his exploding bombs.  The endless scrolling stage is what makes the fight challenging. A constant element of this fight are the randomly placed platforms. While the stage is slowing scrolling upwards, platforms may or may not be there when you need them, so being preemptive is a must. Once Honeybottoms appear herself, things get tricker. With her pink balls that bounce all over the stage, homing bees that traverse up the platforms in a random manner, and triangles that shoot...more triangles, she damands your attention. Her final phase is very straightforward, and being aware will easily net you a win.

<h2>4. Grim Matchstick</h2>

<p>This damn dragon. The first phase is fairly easy, dodging eye lazers, dragon tails, and fireballs. He kicks it up a notch in the second phase with fireballs that randomly fling themselves towards you. Awareness is key since the direction they jump is dependant on your position. It's not until the final phase when you'll ending tearing our hair out. Not only you have to be careful shooting the projectiles, you have to watch for his little flamthrower ablility. This is another stage with randomly placed platforms as clouds. If he's throwing his flamethrower, but there's no upper cloud to jump to, you better make sure you have enough health, or pre plan where you going to position yourself.</p>
<h2>3. Cala Maria </h2>

<p>This boss gave me more trouble than expected. Her first phase is a series of individual attacks from her sea friends. The late part of the phase consists of dealing with ramdom combinations of attacks.  If you get the water horse and she decides to spit out those annoying pirate ghosts, I hope you mastered the shriking ability. Her second phase is as difficult as you want it to be. You can focus on Cala and ignore the eels (and thier many bullets), or focus eels and eat her stone gaze move. It's a tight balance on keeping the eels at bay while maintaining damamge to the boss. Final phase is more annoying than anything. Moving to a tight corrider with stuff to dodge, including that stone gaze move makes the fight more about execution than are more evident in this fact.</p>
<h2>2. Hilda Berg </h2>
<img class = "image" src ="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/reusC7kaUqk/maxresdefault.jpg" align= "center">
<p>For such an early boss, this one gave me a not-so-fun time. I have no idea why I struggled on this one. Making stupid mistakes is my main downfall in this fight. If it's not the enemies shooting random bullets, or the boss and her "Hahaha" attacks, it's her transformations or the random flying stars in the final stage. Of all the pre-King Dice fights, this took the longest to complete.</p>
<h2>1. King Dice Guantlent</h2>
<img class = "image" src ="http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/024/106/cuphead-king-dice-parry.jpg.optimal.jpg" align= "center">
<p>King Dice himself wasn't super hard, but getting to him definately was. His gauntlent is a series of mini-bosses you fight in a row before immediately starting your fight with the king of dice himself. It's imperative to collect as much hearts if you can while travering through the gauntlent. The final fight with King Dice is merely a parry-fest. If you can master that ability, the fight is trivial. Losing takes you back to the beginning of the guantlent, requiring you to once again go through the mini bosses. That, in itself, what makes him the most difficult part of the game. Many times I almost gave up on beating this guy, but with enough determination, I ended triumphant! The devil was a pushover compared to this. </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>And that's all folks! Hope you enjoyed the read. If you haven't tried Cuphead out the game, now's the best time. If you have, what were your hardest bosses? Let me know in the comments!</p>
