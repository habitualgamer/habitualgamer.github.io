<p>More Mega Man news on the way! <!--more--> During the 30th anniversary live stream, Capcom has announced that Mega Man Legacy Collection 1 & 2  will be released on the Nintendo Switch. Collection 1 includes all of the classic Mega Man games from 1 to 6, while Collection 2 has the remaining games form 7 to 10. Both games were previously released on the PS4, Xbox One, and PC, with Collections 2 released August 2017. Expect the Switch versions to come out spring 2018. Mega Man X fans will also be pleased. Capcom is planning on bringing all eight games of the Mega Man X series to the masses. It will be released on all modern consoles, including the Switch. Expect that to come out around summer 2018. With these announcements, anyone with a PC, PS4, Switch or Xbox One will have access to <i>all</i> of the Mega Man games. A pretty sweet deal, if you ask me.
