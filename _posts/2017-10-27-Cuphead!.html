Cuphead is one of the games that I had to succumb to the hype, and I'm glad I did. It's a fun, yet difficult game. It'll charm the pants off ya, and frustrate you at the same time. At this point I'm sure you're aware of it's incredible difficulty, yet I managed it to beat it over the weekend. It wasn't easy though! Now I'm going over the expert stages, and let me tell you, they aint pushovers!

</p>

<p>Just by looking at the game, you can tell what the main draw is. They were going for this retro 1930s theme, and boy did they nail it! This is the first game I've played where I can truely say I'm playing a cartoon. Some of the boss designs are completely out there, in a good way. From blimps that turn into a moon, to a pair of boxing frogs that transform into a slot machine. The artists really let their imaginations go wild with this game. I also love the watercolor backgrounds, and how they interact with the amazingly animated enemies. Not only does this game looks good, but it sounds excellent. If you're a fan of jazz, or music in general, you can appreciate this full band soundtrack. I love that every boss has thier indivdual theme that works with the stage. The songs greatly complement the cartoony rubber hose graphics of yesteryear.</p>

<p>You would think a game that looks and sounds great, would have average gameplay, but you're wrong! The controls are very tight and precise, and the weapons feels solid. Everthing about how Cuphead moves around the screen just feels polished. Any mistake you make, you can attribute to your own messup, instead of blaming cheap shots and bad controls. Thisis also one of the few games were beating a boss truely feels like an accomplishment. It almost forces you to play as perfect as you can, but still provides a lot of fun, even in death.
