<p>Need more winter in your Overwatch? No need to wait any longer!  Overwatch’s Winter Wonderland event is going live today. This limited-time event brings all of skins from last years event, as well as 6 new legendary skins. <!--more--> Mei’s Snowball Offensive makes a return, as well as a new a battle mode, Mei’s Yeti Hunt. This involves five Meis taking down one yeti, or Winston as we call him. Your goal as the yeti is to collect food powerups in order to trigger Primal Rage mode, making him an unstoppable Mei-killing force to be reckoned with. Of course it’s up to the five Meis to bring him down. The match is over once the yeti is killed, or none of the five Meis are left standing. Expect the usual when it comes to events, new sprays, emotes, and so forth.</br></br>

<p>Expect this event to go live on PC, Xbox One, and PS4.</p>
