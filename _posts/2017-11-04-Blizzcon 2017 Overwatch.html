The first day of Blizzcon was exciting will all of their IPs with their respective stages, but Overwatch news is something I always look forward to. What do they have under their sleeves this time? 
</p>

<h2>New Hero- Moira!</h2>

We get a new support hero! I'm excited to try her out, as her play-style looks like a mix of Symettra and Zenyatta. Her overall design is something you would expect out of Overwatch, very "out there". Not much to say about her until I actually get to play her, but I'm sure she'll be on the PTR very soon after the Blizzcon.

<h2>Blizzard World Map</h2>

Now this was something I didn't see coming. When I first saw the art for it, I thought this was a real thing! I mean Blizzard <i>could</i> start their own park if they want. I realized later that is the new hybrid map of Overwatch, meaning it's part Assault, part Payload. The art detail in this map are incredible and it's always good to see cool stuff coming to the game. Blizzard World won't be available until "early next year", but should be on the PTR "soon".

<h2>New Skins</h2>

<p>
Skins aren't a new thing in Overwatch, but these skins are crossing game barriers than ever before. Some are based off of other Blizzard properties and others are based off Overwatch lore. For instance Torborjn now has a Mangi Bronzebeard skin from WoW, Roadhog has a Butcher skin from Diablo, and Widowmaker has a Nova skin from Star Craft. Characters like Mei will have a skin based off her "Rise and Shine" cinematic. Like the new map, they won't appear in the game until early next year. The best news - these skins are available in regular loot boxes, and aren't tied to any events!

<h2>New Reinhardt Video</h2>

<p>
Something else I didn't see coming! The voice actor himself appeared on the Overwatch stage to present the new cinematic. I love these mini-movies because they show a bit of the character's story. Reinhardt's story of how he came to be was a little emotional near the end. It does answer a couple of questions such as who was that guy laying on the throne in the Eichenwalde map, and what happened to Reinhardt's eye. Also, bonus points for featuring Brigitte, his assistant.

Overall, not much was shown that wasn't out of the ordinary, but Overwatch is so engaging in and outside of the game, that any announcement is a good one! Unless it's a Mercy nerf or something. Looking forward to trying out the new content! </p>
