Currently my pc is out of service for a while, so I’m very limited on what games to play on my much slower laptop. Surprisingly, Overwatch is one of those games I can still play!...barely. It takes a while to load everything and there is a slight input lag, but I can still play the game. Of course it’s not optimal for any serious pvp matches, so thank goodness this event came when it did.<!--more--> This really goes to show that Overwatch needs more pve content, as I thought the Retribution mission was outstanding. It’s like an improved version over last year’s event (which was also amazing). Everything about it I loved. The overall presentation, the use of ingame cutscenes (ala WoW), the variety of enemies, the level design. If only Blizzard can make a permanent version of one these events I’ll be golden, but for now these event-only missions will do.

How was the event for you? It’s almost over so there’s time to get the skins you want. As of now, I was only able to get the new Reaper skin, but I play him often, so that’s cool! I wouldn’t mind getting just one more skin, however it’s not a big deal. Let me know what you think in the comments!
