Fans of the Mega Man X will also be pleased, as Capcom is plan on bringing all eight games in the Mega Man X series to the masses. It will be released on all modern consoles, including the Switch. Expect that to come out around summer 2018. With these announcements, that means anyone with a PC, PS4, Switch or Xbox One will have access to <i>all</i> of the Mega Man games. A pretty sweet deal, if you ask me.
