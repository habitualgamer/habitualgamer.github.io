<p>With all the news surrounding Mega Man, it’s inevitable to not talk about your favorite Mega Man moments. While Mega Man 2 was my first time into the series, Mega Man 3 happens to be my all-time favorite Mega Man. Because of one thing: Top Man. Yes, I said Top Man. <!--more-->I mean, what other boss you know that gives you the power to spin? The fact that it actually works on a boss makes it more epic. It didn’t have the most memorable music or any unique gameplay, but hey. Top Man. Can’t beat that. I know Mega Man 3 isn’t everyone's cup of tea, but what your favorite Mega Man game? What about it that sticks to your memory? This include the Mega Man X games as well. Sound out in the comments!
