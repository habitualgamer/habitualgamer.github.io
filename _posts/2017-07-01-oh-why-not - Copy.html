<p>Let's get this party started! Welcome to the beginning of something beautiful. This site is pretty bare and ugly, but in due time it will get prettier, so excuse the dust! This is the place where I will discuss things going on in the gaming world (and sometimes outside) in my point of view. </p>

<p> This aint my first rodeo. I've been blogging on and off for the past 3 years. Sucks that life gets in the way a lot, but those are the breaks, I guess! Anyhow, I figure I use this first text to talk about myself a bit. </p>

<p> I am what you considered a 'gamer'. Ever since I had my first Atari system, I knew this is what I will be doing for a long time. Growing up back in the Nintendo-Sega wars were the best times of my gaming life, considering I also had both systems eventually! I was always a closet RPG fan with titles like Illusion of Gaia, Chorno Trigger (though I never played it in it's limelight), Star Ocean 2, Xenogears and others that caputred my imagination. I was the few that didn't mind reading a line of text, especially if the story was good. Fast forward to now, after playing countless of moderen RPGs I still enjoy the genre. MMORPGs also have my affection, though they're harder to really sit down to enjoy now these days. The many hours lost on WoW, Aion, Rift traversing the worlds and progressioning your character. One day I will return, but as for now, I'm enjoying other genres that I might've ignored.</p>

<p>I can go on and on about the different games I enjoy, but I'll reserve that for another time. Currently Nintendo has gotten my attention again, and I will be talking about them more than I usually would. Until next time readers, thanks for stopping by!</p>
