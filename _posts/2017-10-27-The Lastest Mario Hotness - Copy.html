We're just about more than half a year from the Switches initial launch, and it's flagship hero Mario is ready for another 3D platform adventure. Call it an "odyssey" of sorts. The story doesn't stray away from it's previous games. Princess Peach is kidnapped by Bowser again, and it's up to Mario and its ghosty assistant to track Bowser through numerous of worlds called 'kingdoms'. New powers include the ability to possess other enemies that provide some depth to the typical platform gameplay.

The game is full retail price, but I'm sure it's more than worth it. Once I get a Switch, this will be one of the games on my list!
